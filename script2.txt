Scorpion's revenge arc is interesting to analyze because while most characters change their ways after getting their revenge, Scorpion changed before getting his ultimate revenge and still achieved it. After being exonerated from his revenant status, he rebuilt the Shirai Ryu from the ground up and even made amends with Sub-Zero, but once Quan-Chi was captured by Special Forces, he still held a grudge and killed the sorcerer.
