While I do like the changes made to Sektor and Cyrax, I understand the grievances other MK Fans have. Swapping Sektor and Cyrax's genders feel like a pointless change in the name of being inclusive when there are many ready-made female characters they could've chose from, and the removal of the Cyber-Initiative in favor of Iron-Man-like powersuits remove the weight of turning humans into unthinking machines to ensure total loyalty without fear of rebellion.
